## Steps to Update and Preview the Theme

1. Clone this repository
1. Open NordTheme.sln
1. Double click on the NordTheme.vstheme
1. Make modifications in the right properties (there are a lot of them)

> One note, Apply actually installs it on all instances of Visual Studio 2019

## Contributions

Willing to accept any and all contributions. I love the Nord theme and have been using it for everything so far. My love for the Visual Studio editor had me do this in my spare time.
